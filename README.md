=========

I randomly thought about setting multiple HTML divs with 100% height, and it turns out this is a really easy way to have vertical scrolling "slides".

I want to implement some cleaner transitions as seen on the login/registration forms on the demo  [here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/27/login-and-registration-form-with-html5-and-css3/)

This project uses no JavaScript.
